# What are functional or SAM interfaces?
> An interface with only one abstract method is known as a functional interface. As a result, it's also known as the SAM (Single Abstract Method) interface. Because it covers a function as an interface, or in other words, because a function is represented by a single abstract method of the interface, it's called a functional interface.

> Default, static, and overridden methods can all be found in functional interfaces. The @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to declare Functional Interfaces. This annotation will cause a compiler error if it is used on interfaces with more than one abstract method.
