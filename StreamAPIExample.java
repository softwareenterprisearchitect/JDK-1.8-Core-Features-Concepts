> Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
> A new java.util.stream has been added in Java 8 to perform filter/map/reduce like operations with the collection. 
> Stream API will allow sequential as well as parallel execution. This is one of the best features for me because I work a lot with Collections and usually with Big Data, we need to filter out them based on some conditions.
Collection interface has been extended with stream() and parallelStream() default methods to get the Stream for sequential and parallel execution. Letâ€™s see their usage with a simple example.
